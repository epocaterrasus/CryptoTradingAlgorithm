DEEP LEARNING FOR TIME SERIES FORECASTING - JASON BROWNLEE
Time series data can be phrased as supervised learning. Given a sequence of numbers for a time
series dataset, we can restructure the data to look like a supervised learning problem. We can
do this by using previous time steps as input variables and use the next time step as the output
variable.

The sweet spot for using machine learning for time series is where classical methods fall
down. This may be with complex univariate time series, and is more likely with multivariate
time series given the additional complexity.
