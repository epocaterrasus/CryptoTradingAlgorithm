# Crypto Price Forecasting Tool using Deep Learning <br/>

During this project, we aimed to explore the possibility of using deep learning to forecast future cryptocurrency token prices. We used technical analysis indicators as parameters to train and test the model, we started with over ninety different technical indicators and used correlation analysis and dimensionality reduction techniques to synthetize the information to get fewer inputs. Applying this procedure also helped us reduce model overfitting problems, achieving a better bias-variance trade-off. 

## Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* hvPlot
* matplotlib
* numpy
* requests
* scikit-learn
* seaborn
* ta
* tensorflow
* vastAI

## Data

We acquired our data using the KuCoin API database to acquire Open, High, Low, Close and Volume Information for individual tokens. If you would like to learn more about this API please follow the following link: [KuCoin](https://docs.kucoin.com/ "KuCoin")

## Installation and User Guide

The main jupyter notebook contains in the top cell, two terminal commands to download the required libraries in the machine you're launching the notebook on:
```
!python -m pip install --upgrade pip
!pip install -r './requirements.txt'
```
If you're running the code locally and this doesn't work, just install the required libraries from your terminal in your environment of choice:
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Download Repository

To download the project repository please run the following command in your GitBash window located in a directory of choice:
``` git clone https://github.com/epocaterrasus/CryptoTradingAlgorithm.git ```

### Launching the Application locally

To launch the application, run the following command in GitBash (inside the main folder of the repo).
```jupyter lab```

Locate the ```main_v2_vast.ipynb``` within Jupyter Lab and start exploring our project!

### Launching the Application on Vast.ai

Log in into your Vast.ai account and dive into the console which should look like this:

## What we want to figure it out?

* Can we generate alpha in cryptocurrency trading by using technical analysis indicators?
* Is the efficiency of using technical analysis higher in cryptocurrencies than in regular equities?
* Do we get better or worse results when analyzing established vs emerging tokens?
* Is there an inherent loop, meaning that in the absence of fundamental changes (upgrades to the chain i.e. proof of stake deployment in Ethereum) will the model continue to work indefinetely?

## Our process

* Outline - Identify goals, data sources and technologies to be used.
* Technical Analysis Indicators - Creating over ninety technical indicators using the TA library, for more information on the indicators and what they represent please visit [TA Library](https://technical-analysis-library-in-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "TA Library").
* Data Processing - Scaling, Dimensionality Reduction and Windowing.
* Model Creation - Secuential Model
* Tuning - Changing number of components, adjusting lookback window
